STEPS OF DATA SCRAPPING FROM THE LINKEDIN WEBSITE

1. Setting Up:
    The code imports libraries to control a web browser and work with data.
    It stores your LinkedIn username and password (Warning: This is not secure. Consider using environment variables or secure storage).
    It sets up a tool to control the Chrome web browser.

2. Logging In:
    The code opens the LinkedIn website.
    It waits for the login page to load and then types your username and password.
    It clicks the login button and waits for the main LinkedIn page to load.

3. Preparing for Data Collection:
    The code creates a container to store job information (designation, company, etc.).
    It identifies all the page numbers on the current job listings page (assuming they have a specific class name).

4. Looping Through Job Listing Pages:
    The code loops through each page number, potentially scraping jobs from all available pages.
    On each page, it clicks the corresponding page number to navigate.
    It waits a few seconds (not ideal) to allow the page to load.
    The code then identifies all the job listings on the current page (assuming they have a specific class name).

5. Extracting Data from Each Job Listing:
    The code loops through each job listing on the current page.
    For each job listing, it clicks on it to open the details page.
    It scrolls down the page to the bottom.
    The code then tries to extract various details about the job and company from the page:
    Job title (designation)
    Company name
    Company size (number of employees)
    Company followers on LinkedIn
    Job seniority level
    Number of applicants (might be inaccurate)
    Job location

6. Storing Extracted Data:
    If the code successfully finds each data element, it stores the information in the container created earlier.


Overall, this code automates logging into LinkedIn and scraping data from job listings across potentially multiple pages.
